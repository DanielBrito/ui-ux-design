# Conducting User Interviews - Notes

Learn how to validate product ideas by identifying an audience, sourcing participants, conducting user interviews, and analyzing the results.

## Why Research?

To create great users experiences, you need to know your users' frustrations and "pain points." User interviews are a great way to gather that information and create the best possible product.

## Identifying Your Target Audience

### **Definitions:**

- *Target audience* - The group of people you perceive to be the main users of a product
- *Participant criteria* - The qualities you're looking for in the people who participate in your user interview.
- *Assumption* - Something that is accepted as true or you believe to be true, even though you don't have proof.

- *User interview* - A method for gathering information, through direct dialogue.
- *Rationalization* - A psychological phenomenon in which we humans, change the reality we tell others about.

## Ask the Right Questions

Jumpstart your interviews with this list of recommended interview questions.

### **Types of questions:**

- **Sequence.** Walk me through your day.
- **Exhaustive list.** What are all the situations where you pull out a piece of paper and write something down?
- **Quantitative/inventory.** How many times did you take notes yesterday?
- **Suggestive opinion.** Some people have very negative feelings about taking notes while driving a car. What are your feelings about it?
- **Activities.** What do you typically do when you get ready for a trip?
- **Exceptions.** Can you tell me about a time when you had a problem taking notes with an app?
- **Reenactment.** Could you please show me how you do that?
- **Failures.** What would be the worst-case scenario?
- **Fill in the blank.** After you ask a question, hold yourself back and give them time to respond.

## Follow-ups

Once you've asked a question, you should dig deeper to learn more from the person you're interviewing. Follow-up questions are important at getting to deeper insights about your users and their motivations.

### **Follow-up Questions:**

- **Point to reactions, contradictions, paradoxes, unexpected reactions, or laughter** that might help reveal an important story. Why do you laugh when you mention Facebook?
- **Clarification**, when you say that, you mean your laptop, right?
- **Reflecting back**, so what I hear you're saying is, is that right? Reflecting back might uncover a more accurate story and help eliminate rationalization.
- **Native language**, why do you call your phone, my extended arm? Your interviewees' jargon can teach you a lot about the meaning they attach to different things.
- **Why?** When you hear an answer about something, make sure you understand it by asking why. Ask the interviewee to explain their behavior and choices. If why sounds a bit aggressive, replace it with the softer, "tell me more about that."

## What to Avoid

While there's no exact way to conduct a user interview, there are definite questions and styles you should avoid so you can encourage honest and helpful answers.

### **What to Avoid in a User Interview**

- **Don't intimidate.** Standing while your interviewee is sitting is not a good idea. You're intimidating them.
- **Don't ask sensitive, personal questions.** They make your participants uncomfortable.
- **Don't ask yes/no questions without asking why.**
- **Don't ask long questions.** By the time you finish, they forget what you asked.
- **Don't use jargon** because they don't understand it.
- **Don't talk too much.**
- **Don't explain your questions.**
- **Don't ignore body language.** While they might say one thing, their body language might be saying something else.
- **Don't ask for product feedback.** You don't want feedback, you want to observe behavior.
- **Don't ask to predict the future.** We talked about that.
- **Don't pitch your product.** This is not a sales call. This is an interview.
- \*Don't analyze the answers in your mind. \*\* You'll have time for that later.
