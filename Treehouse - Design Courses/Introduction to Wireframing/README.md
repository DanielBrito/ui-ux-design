# Introduction to Wireframing - Notes

Wireframing is a useful part of the design process. Throughout a website or mobile app project, you will have a lot of ideas and the best way to sort through those ideas is to brainstorm. Wireframes are a visual artifact of brainstorming, and the goal is to make them with minimal effort, as to encourage ideation. Whether you're a designer or not, wireframing is an important skill to have in your toolkit. It's beneficial for product managers, marketers, or anyone else with ideas for a website or mobile app. Wireframes are a valuable tool for visualizing user experiences, iterating on ideas, and sharing ideas with others.

## What Are Wireframes?

Whether you're a designer or not, wireframing is an important skill to have in your toolkit. Wireframes are a valuable tool for visualizing user experiences, iterating on ideas, and sharing ideas with others.

### **New Terms:**

- _Wireframing_: A drawing which visualizes the elements of a website or mobile app

## Types of Wireframes

There are a few different types of wireframes. In this video, we will discuss a set that ranges in fidelity. Fidelity, in this context, refers to the amount of detail in the wireframe. There are low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes.

### **New Terms:**

- _Low-fidelity wireframe_: A low-fidelity wireframe is an early stage, barebones drawing with minimal polish. It is typically more loosely drawn and hints at the specific elements on the page.
- _High-fidelity wireframe_: A high-fidelity wireframe is more polished and displays more specific or realistic renderings of content.
- _Thumbnail wireframes_: Thumbnail wireframes are small representations of a screen. They allow you to quickly try out different layout ideas and visualize the hierarchy of content without getting too involved in a larger, more detailed wireframe

## How Wireframes Are Used

We will go over the process of creating a wireframe. The process will differ depending on your team's resources and the project timeline, but here's a best case scenario.

### The Process: Best Case Scenario

1. Review the user research and business goals
2. Iterate on low-fidelity wireframes
3. Get internal feedback
4. Iterate on low-fidelity wireframes (again)
5. Polish the selected low-fidelity wireframe into a high-fidelity wireframe
6. Get internal feedback (again)
7. Get user feedback
8. Continue along in the design process: The next step is up to you.
   1. Create a mockup and start implementing it with code.
   2. Start over with a new set of wireframes. This is totally OK!

## Hand-drawn Wireframes

There are a few different ways to create wireframes, but let's start with the basics: pen and paper. It's simple, gets the job done, and avoids the trap of perfecting the wireframe.

## Demonstration of Wireframing on Paper

Now that you know the basic components of wireframes, we'll show you how to apply that knowledge to a real-world project.

### **New Terms:**

- _Persona_: The user profile of a theoretical user who represents a larger group of potential users. These user profiles are helpful in putting a name and a face with decisions you make about your users.
- _Empathy map_: A tool used to consider the user’s perception of what happens as they use the product. This helps shape our insights into our users and lets us focus on what their thoughts and feelings may be.
- _User flow_: A document that outlines the progression of ideal user behavior through key moments in their interaction with a product
- _Crazy Eights_: A fast brainstorming exercise that challenges you to create eight different ideas, sometimes within a deadline of 8 minutes.

## Tips and Tools

We will review our wireframes and mark the components we like the most. You may like pieces of each wireframe, and for the next iteration, you maybe want to combine those concepts into one wireframe.

## The Pros and Cons of Wireframing on Paper

There are multiple methods for wireframing, and paper is just one of them. Here we will go over some of the positive and negative characteristics of the hand-drawn method.

### **Pro:**

- Cost effective
- Easy to have tools on hand
- Rough draft allows for honest feedback without concerns about the design being 'too perfect' or 'too finalized'
- Offline work can help you avoid internet distractions

### **Con:**

- Moving final wireframe to a mockup will require you to create it on a computer anyway
- Requires manual repetition as you iterate on your wireframes
