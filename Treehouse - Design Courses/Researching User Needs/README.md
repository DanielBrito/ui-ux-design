# Researching User Needs - Notes

Many products are developed based on a hunch, a judgement call, and incomplete information. Needless to say, most of them fail miserably. Startup founders and business owners then ask themselves why. This course takes a different, risk-mitigating, more scientific approach to the art of starting a business. You’ll learn how to develop a product people really need by uncovering these needs well in advance. Before you write one line of code, before you hire a large team, before you take a big risk. You’ll learn the ins and outs of learning if people need your product by implementing three activities to learn from your future customers - Experience Sampling, Field Observation, and Interviewing. After making sense of it all, you’ll be able to kick-start your business with confidence in your knowledge and wisdom.
