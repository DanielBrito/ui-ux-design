## How to Choose a Text Typeface for the Web

To continue on the theme of hierarchy, we’ll look at how you achieve it through caps and color.

## Combining Typefaces

Pairing typefaces may seem tricky at first, but we’ll look at what makes a good combination.

### **Advice**

A good rule of thumb is to keep it simple. Mixing many typefaces in one design can easily look disorganized and confusing if not done well.

### **Resources**

- Hoefler & Co's **[techniques for combining fonts](http://www.typography.com/techniques/index.php)**
- **[Fonts in Use](http://fontsinuse.com/)**
- **[Combining Typefaces](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/combining-typefaces)**, Tim Brown
- **[A Guide to Combining Fonts](https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2018/08/15/guide-to-combining-fonts/)**
  - Stay within a typeface and choose different weights.
  - Pair a sans-serif with a serif from the same family. Example: **[FF Meta](https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/meta)** & **[FF Meta Serif](https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/meta-serif)** by **[Erik Spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/en/)**.
- Mixing different typefaces:
  - Select typefaces with similar characteristics: similar **[x-height](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height)**, characters with similar shape and proportions.

## Responsive Typography

When responsive design is thrown into the mix, typography on sites is often neglected at different screen sizes. We’ll look at the main determining factors we should be thinking about as we make responsive design choices.

## The Fine Details

- Pay attention to danglies (single words in lines)
- Use proper punctuation
- Check out fonts with stylistic alternates
