# Evaluating Design - Notes

An essential part of the UX design process is measurement and validation. This course will provide an overview of the methods available for measuring the success of a design including A/B testing, surveys and usability testing. It will specifically deep dive into usability testing so that students will learn about what’s involved in running such a test, from preparing a test plan to presenting actionable findings.

## The Three Phases of Research

User research covers a wide breadth of methods from initial ethnographic interviews to usability research to quantitative research. You can use research to inspire your design, to evaluate it, and to measure its impact. For this course, we’ll be focusing on the second of these phases - evaluating your design.

### **New Terms:**

- Generative Research Phase - Researching user needs. The intention of this first phase is to inspire and to uncover the needs of your users well in advance of starting your design work. It is about defining the problem.
- Tactical Research Phase - Evaluate your design or prototype.
- Evaluative Research Phase - Evaluate your final product in a real context.

### **Test early to...**

1. Make sure you are addressing a real user need
2. Confirm your design is usable
3. Save total development time
4. Minimize the cost of product support

---

## Understanding Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research

There are two categories of research: Qualitative and Quantitative.

### **New Terms:**

- Qualitative Research - Researching with the intent of understanding the range of behavior for your desired audience as well as the motivations and perceptions that lead them there.
- Quantitative Research - A structured method of data gathering and analysis involving mathematical rigor.

---

## Approaches to Usability Research

Usability testing is asking people representative of your target audience to evaluate your idea by using your product or prototype to perform realistic tasks while you observe, ask questions, and record everything that you see and hear.

**New Terms:**

- *Empirical data* - Information gathered through experimentation and observation.

**Defining attributes of a usability study**

1. Participants from your target audience
2. Realistic tasks using your product or prototype
3. In-depth questioning
4. Collection of empirical data

---

## Moderated Testing

**New Terms:**

- **Moderated testing** - A test during which a moderator is present to ask questions in real-time in order to deeply understand each choice the participant makes.

**Advantages of a moderated study**

- Probe deeper
- Capture participant reactions
- Protect sensitive information
- Evaluate low fidelity concepts
- Stay on track
- Test complex products

**Research Tools: [List of tools available to record, observe, and analyze the final video](http://remoteresear.ch/tools/)**

---

## Unmoderated Testing

Moderated testing can provide a deep personal understanding of the users, but it can also be heavily time and resource-consuming. Although traditional usability testing has been moderated by a researcher in real-time, there are now many available alternatives online.

### **New Terms:**

**Unmoderated testing** - Remote testing that does not require the participation of a facilitator.

**Why run an online unmoderated study?**

1. Fast and affordable
2. Scalable
3. Alleviate the observer effect
   - Other possible biases can be found at **[9 Biases in Usability Testing](https://measuringu.com/ut-bias/)**
4. Keep participants in their natural space

**When choosing an unmoderated testing tool, consider:**

1. Screen and audio recording
2. Customizable recruiting criteria
3. Ability to test anything
4. Customizable tasks
5. Questions
6. Speed
7. Quantitative analytics
8. Longitudinal studies

**Further Reading:**

## Introducing the Usability Plan

After reviewing the proposed Usability Test Plan in the previous step, did you find anything off?

### **Test Plans**

1. **[Original Amazon Usability Test Plan](Original_UsabilityTestPlan.pdf)**
2. **[Amazon Usability Test Plans with Edits](Edited_UsabilityTestPlan.pdf)**
3. **[Final Amazon Usability Test Plan](Final_Usability_Test_Plan.pdf)**

## Writing a Test Script

Once your Test Plan is done, you will need to create your test script. This is vital for every researcher regardless of experience level.

### **Components of a usability study script**

1. Set up the study
2. Make participants comfortable
3. Ask background questions
4. Use consistent scenarios

---

## Usability Test Script (Example)

Read through the Amazon.com usability test script. In the next section, we will watch it being acted it out.

---

### **Things to do while your usability subject is settling in:**

1. Welcome.
2. Offer water or restroom before we get started.
3. Show participants where to sit.
4. Confirm non­disclosure/consent form has been signed
5. Once settled into places...

### **Introduction**

"Thank you for taking the time to participate in our usability study. From now on, I will be reading from a script to make sure I don't miss any important details. I invited you here today so you can help us learn about how people buy AC units for their homes. From now on, I will be recording the screen, including your mouse movements, and your voice. This will ensure that I don't miss any valuable information as we move through the study. It will also allow those who aren't able to observe the study, to watch the video later. None of this footage will be used outside of our product team. The information that we do gather will be anonymized so that we can draw general conclusions about the product (and certainly not you!).

There are currently people watching this study from another room. I may check in with them occasionally to ask if they have any questions for you.

I want you to know that I am a researcher and not a designer, so don't worry about offending me with your feedback. We are testing the product and NOT you. Any and all feedback is helpful for us. Any challenges or problems you observe are a fault of the product and not you, so don't hold back and be honest in everything you say. Your honesty and openness are what are most valuable to me.

I ask you to please think aloud. This means speaking what you are thinking as you use the product throughout the study. If you forget to do this, I will remind you along the way because it is just as important for me to know why you're doing something like the fact that you are doing it.

Do you have any questions before we begin?"

### **Background questions**

"I will now ask you a few background questions to get started. If you are not comfortable answering any of them, just ask to skip that question"

- _Questions marked with a star (_) are here to verify the participant is qualified for this study.\*

1. What is your profession?
2. How often do you shop online? \*
3. Do you have an Amazon.com account? \*
4. Are you a homeowner or renter? \*
5. How many other adults & children are in your household?
6. How do you currently cool your home?
7. Do you have central air conditioning where you live? \*
8. Have you purchased an AC unit in the last year? \*

### **Scenarios**

_Answers to the indented questions should be observed as much as possible. If the answers are not obvious, then ask the participant in the context of the task._

1. "Please go to Amazon.com. Once there, find an air conditioning unit that would be a good fit for your home and proceed to purchase that unit. I will make sure to stop you before your credit card is charged. If you need to look at a different website to make your decision, please feel free to go there along the way."
   1. Do they have all the information that they need to make a decision? Is there additional information that people need to make their purchase decisions?
   2. Are there obstacles preventing the participant from making an AC purchase on Amazon.com?
   3. Do price-conscious site visitors notice or consider the Buy Used option?
   4. Does the Amazon's Choice or Best Seller label help to make purchase decisions?
   5. Do consumers notice or consider the Expert Installation option as part of their purchase?
2. "Let's assume that you know exactly what unit you want to purchase and that is the Frigidaire FFRE0533S1 5,000 BTU". Please show me how you would purchase that specific item."
   1. Are there obstacles preventing the participant from making an AC purchase on Amazon.com?
3. "If you think you would be more likely to purchase your AC from a website other than Amazon.com, please show me that website and walk me through how you would make that purchase."
   1. What are examples of other websites that customers think are better for AC purchases?
   2. Why are they better?

### **Follow Up Questions**

1. "On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being very easy and 1 being very difficult, what is your impression of the process for purchasing an AC unit from Amazon.com?"
2. "Is there anything that you would change about what you've seen today to improve the Amazon shopping experience?"
3. "Anything else you'd like to tell us what we haven't discussed yet?"

### **Ending**

"Thank you, I will now turn off the recording."

## A/B Testing

The first method of quantitative testing that we’ll be discussing is A/B testing. This method compares two or more versions of a website or app to find which one performs better on a specific conversion metric.

### **How to know when to run an A/B test and how to get started running one**

1. Something is off in your analytics data
2. Find out why
3. Propose a potential solution

### **New terms:**

**Control group** - People who see the original website design. This is used as the baseline for your experiment.

**Experimental group** - People who see the design being tested.

**Multivariate testing** - Technique for testing multiple concepts at the same time.

**Conversion rate** - Rate at which visitors to your site get to a particular goal that you have chosen (ex. making a purchase, signing up for a service or subscribing to a newsletter)

**[Guideline for helping you determine the sample size.](https://measuringu.com/ab-testing/)**  _(refer to the chart in Sample Sizes section)_

**Additional considerations when reviewing the study outcome**

1. Are you using multiple sources of data?
2. Did your design solution not improve the outcome?
3. Did you study the user segments?

### **Real-life examples**

**FaceBook Feed** - Ever notice that your FB feed looks different, but when you mention it to your friends, they don’t know what you’re talking about? That’s likely because you’re part of an experiment in FaceBook is running. Let’s imagine you see a new Live Feed design. What do you think is a possible metric that FaceBook is evaluating? It could be time on site, click-through-rate on their ads or a friend’s post, etc.

**Shopping site checkout flow** - Let’s say that Amazon wants to know if a slightly darker shade of orange on their Checkout button will increase conversions. Given their size, they might allot just 1% of their traffic to use the new color and after a few days, they’ll have a large enough sample to know if this change is worthwhile.

---

## Funnel Analysis

Now we’ll look at how to analyze the series of events that lead to a desired goal. This is referred to as a “funnel” because though many individuals can enter the funnel, only a small number of them will get to the intended goals. A Funnel analysis is used to understand exactly what steps people use to get to a particular goal and where the user drop-off is along the way.

---

## User Survey Basics

Surveys have many uses and can include both quantitative and qualitative questions. They can be used for marketing purposes to understand how people feel about your product area of interest. For this course, we’ll be focusing strictly on how to use surveys to assess the design of a product. This can be the product you’re about to redesign (so that you know what has been working well and what hasn’t) as well as for the new product you already have designs for.

### **New terms**

**Intercept surveys** - A survey that appears in a specific context and time, requesting that the user completes the questions immediately. Can be online or in-person. However, the current course will only refer to its use online.

**Common types of research goals**

1. Deeper understanding of qualitative research findings
2. Evaluate the launch of a new feature
3. Prepare for a site redesign

**Survey questions available**

1. Close ended & Open ended
2. Demographic
3. Likert Scale
4. Stack ranking

**Survey design best practices**

1. Lead with interesting questions
2. Keep text short
3. Group by topic
4. Don't ask about behavior
5. Avoid questions with two concepts
6. Use neutral questions
7. Make survey anonymous
