# Designing Interactions - Notes

Learn the principles of Interaction Design, including the five dimensions, interaction models, and cognitive psychology. Apply those principles by learning how to design interactions in a design program.

## What's Interaction Design?

To get started, let's consider the definition of Interaction Design and how it relates to the User Experience.

**New Terms:**

- _Interaction Design_: “Interaction Design is the creation of a dialogue between a person and a product, system, or service. This dialogue is both physical and emotional in nature and is manifested in the interplay between form, function, and technology as experienced over time.” - John Kolko
- _The Media Equation_: The theory that people tend to treat computers as if they were either real people or real places

- **[Designing Interfaces](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-interfaces-3rd/9781492051954/)** by Jenifer Tidwell, Charles Brewer, and Aynne Valencia-Brooks

## Five Dimensions

**Five dimensions of Interaction Design:**

- words (1D)
- visual representations (2D)
- physical objects/space (3D)
- time (4D)
- behavior (5D)

## Types of Interactions

What types of interactions are possible? We'll look at examples of interactions across desktop (Google Drive) and mobile apps (Photo Gallery, Google Maps).

## Microinteractions

Now we'll delve into microinteractions, which are tiny interactions that can make a big impact on the user experience.

**New Terms:**

- _Microinteractions_: contained product moments that revolve around a single use case

**Parts of a microinteraction**

- trigger
- rules
- feedback
- loops or modes

---

## Feedback Messages

Feedback informs the user of the system status and tells them what to expect.

**Common types of feedback:**

- success
- warning
- error
- informational messages.

## Cognitive Psychology: Mental Models

Now it's time for a bit of cognitive psychology. We'll look at how the human brain processes information and how users approach the user interface with set expectations.

**New Terms:**

- _Cognitive psychology_: the scientific study of mental processes
- _Mental model_: an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world.

**Processes:**

- attention
- language use
- memory
- perception
- problem-solving
- creativity
- thinking

**Alan Dix's four golden rules of navigation:**

- Knowing where you are
- Knowing what you can do
- Knowing where you are going - or what will happen
- Knowing where you've been - or what you've done

## Cognitive Psychology: Affordances

Affordances help users know what to expect from a user interface. In this video, we'll better understand how an affordance is defined, and then we'll break affordances down into different types.

**New Term:**

- _Affordances, as defined by James Gibson_: the actions provided to the actor by the environment
- _Affordances, as defined by Don Norman_: “Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things. Plates are for pushing. Knobs are for turning. Slots are for inserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction needed."

**Types of Affordances:**

- Explicit
- Pattern
- Hidden
- False
- Negative

## Psychological Principles

There are several laws in Interaction Design. These psychological principles help guide designers to make intuitive user interfaces. We'll look at three popular laws: Hick's, Fitts's, and Tesler's.

**New Terms:**

- _Hick’s Law_: The more choices a person is presented with, the longer the person will take to reach a decision.
- _Tesler’s Law (aka Law of conservation of complexity)_: Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden.
- _Fitts’s law_: The amount of time required for a person to move a cursor to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.

## Sensation and Perception

How are digital products sensed and perceived? Let's take a closer look.

**New Terms:**

- _Sensation_: the immediate, relatively unprocessed result of stimulation of sensory receptors, such as touch, smell, taste, hearing, and vision
- _Perception_: how sensory information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced
- _Proprioception_: an awareness of the position and movement of the body
