# Prototyping in the Browser - Notes

Before you design a website, it's important to have some kind of a plan or a wireframe to guide your efforts. But sometimes when you go from a simple sketch to digital pixels, the results aren't exactly what you expect. When you work with real HTML and CSS, and you're able to see your site on a real screens, you're able to see a more accurate representation of the final result. In this course, we're going to build a website prototype using the Bootstrap web framework.

## HTML Structure

Using our mockup, let's start blocking out the major content areas for the mobile and desktop layouts. Using Bootstrap, we can do a lot of the work for both layouts in parallel, which is one of the big advantages of using a front-end framework.

## Solutions to Common Design Problems

When you're browsing the web, often you'll come across design elements that are similar to many other websites you've seen before. The same design solutions appear over and over again because designers face the same types of problems over and over again.

## Responsive Menus

There are enough menu items at the top of the page, that the navigation menu breaks down on smaller screens like those on a mobile phone. It'd look better in the menu collapsed neatly when it's at mobile sizes. That way, we can add more menu items in the future without fear of cluttering up the navigation.

### **Resources**

- **[Bootstrap: Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)** - This section of the Bootstrap documentation details the navbar component, which can be used to create a row of links and a responsive menu that collapses into a button.

## Image Carousels

Featuring an image at the top of the page helps to call out a designer's best work, but what if they want to feature different types of images? It would be nice if users could show more than one featured image at the top of the page.

### **Resources**

- **[Bootstrap: Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/)** - This section of the Bootstrap documentation details the carousel component, which can be used to cycle through a series of images, text, or other HTML content.
