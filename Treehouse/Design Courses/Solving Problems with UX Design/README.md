# Solving Problems with UX Design - Notes

Product design is about solving problems. Learn how to identify problems, understand the difference between "needs" and "wants," and how to convert a problem statement into a hypothesis you can test with user research.

## What is a problem?

A problem is defined by two components: 1. The gap between the current and desired state. 2. How much the problem owner wants to do something about it.

## Wants vs. Needs

In most cases, there’s a very big difference between what people say they need and what they actually need.

**New Terms:**

- _Need_: A need is a necessity arising from a certain problem, a real problem.
- _Want_: A want is what people think or say they need.

---

## Attitudes vs. Behaviors

In most cases, there’s a very big difference between what people say they need and what they actually need. This difference can be described in terms of attitude and behavior.

**New Terms:**

- _Attitude_: Attitude is how people think they behave. It signals what people want.
- _Behavior_: Behavior is how people actually behave. It signals what people need.

## Developing a Hypothesis

Once you know how to identify a problem to solve, the next step is to create a hypothesis. Then, you can test your assumptions by conducting research, such as interviewing users in the product's target audience.

**Hypothesis structure:**

- We believe that *[doing this, building this feature, creating this experience]* for *[these people/personas]* will achieve *[this outcome]*. We will know this to be true when we see *[this market feedback, quantitative measure, or qualitative insight]*.
