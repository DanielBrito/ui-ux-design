# Designing Layouts - Notes

## Spelling, Grammar, and Title Casing

It's important that you follow the rules of grammar and spelling when creating apps and websites, because it builds trust with your user. If a user spots a word that's spelled incorrectly, they might start to wonder what else is wrong with your product, and that could impact really important moments in the experience, like a purchase decision.

## Headers and Labels

The visual design of an interface can only communicate so much. At some point, designers and users must rely on text, and how that text is written can greatly influence the quality of a user experience.

## Typography and Hierarchy

The layout is better than when we started, but it's unclear how some elements relate to one another. Some fonts are too large, others are too small, and their placement could be better to indicate a visual hierarchy.

## Using a Grid

When creating layouts, most designers use a grid system that's comprised of a series of columns of equal width, separated by some space called gutters.

## Colors and Contrast

The last thing we need to work on are some colors that fit the brand a little better. Additionally, there are some areas that have low contrast and are difficult to read, either literally or visually.
