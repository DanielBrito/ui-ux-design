# Accessibility For UX Designers - Notes

## What is Accessible Design?

Accessible design is a design process that specifically considers the needs of people with disabilities. Having empathy for your users means remembering that not everyone uses the web in the same way. Some users rely on assistive technology to help them access the web.

## **Common Assistive Technologies**

- **Screen reader**: software that reads web content aloud to assist visually impaired users
- **Screen magnifier**: used to enlarge content for users with sight impairments
- **Switch controls**: a switch allows users with motor impairments to control your site without the use of a touchscreen, mouse, or keyboard
- **Closed captioning**: used to make videos accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing users, as well as users with Auditory Processing Disorder

### **Vocabulary**

- **Accessible design**: a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered
- **Curb-cut effect**: the idea that accessibility has benefits beyond allowing people with disabilities to use your product

## WCAG Principles: Perceivable

The WCAG principle called Perceivable states that information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This principle is all about providing alternative methods of understanding your web content. If users can’t see your content, for example, let them hear it.

### **WCAG Perceivable Principle**

- Text alternatives
- Captions and transcripts
- Portrait and landscape orientation
- Sufficient color contrast
- Combine multiple visual cues, not just color
- Avoid autostarting audio or video
- Responsive body copy
- Legible at 200% zoom

## WCAG Principles: Operable

People with disabilities must be able to Operate your web content. The Operable principle is all about removing barriers between your user and your content.

### **WCAG Operable Principle**

- Keyboard navigation
- Obvious focus indicators
- Allow enough time
- Disable distracting content
- Careful with flashing animations
- Help users navigate
- Make link purpose clear
- Provide alternatives to complex interactions
- Generous target sizes

---

## WCAG Principles: Understandable

People with disabilities must be able to understand your content and use your interfaces.

### **WCAG Understandable Principle**

- Set HTML language attribute
- Use plain language
- Create predictable navigation
- No unexpected changes in context
- Make errors easy to spot and correct

### **Vocabulary**

- **Change in context**: To avoid disorienting users, the following should happen only when the user initiates a change by interacting with an interface element:
  - opening a new window
  - loading a new page
  - significantly rearranging page content
  - moving focus to a new component.

## WCAG Principles: Robust

The fourth and final WCAG principle, Robust, states that “Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.” But what does that really mean?

### **WCAG Robust Principle**

- Write valid HTML
- Use semantic markup
- Changes in content status

## Form Accessibility

### **Principles of an Accessible Form**

- Avoid unnecessary questions
- Minimize questions per screen
- Provide context clues
- Group related questions
- Use clear input labels
- Make focus indicators obvious
- Help users spot and correct errors

---

## Error reporting screen

### **When Reporting Form Errors**

- Make messages easy to notice and understand
- Highlight errors visually
- Keep instructions simple
