# Usability Foundations - Notes

## Defining Usability

Usability is an important aspect of design because you want people to use the things you build. You want them to use it for its intended purpose, and to be successful at whatever they're trying to do.

## The History of Usability

If we look back at how usability has evolved over the years along with the web, we can anticipate issues that might arise in the future.

### Usability Needs

- Efficient, fast, and reliable designs
- Accessible content across channels
- Important features must work on all devices

---

## The First Impression

Opinions about websites are often made within seconds. An important part of providing a positive first impression is matching the user's expectations to the reality of what they find on the site.

---

## Architecture and Menus

Organizing content on a website is a vital part of usability, and no two sites are organized the same way. Anticipating user needs understanding how and where they will look for content.

---

## Text Content

Whether you are a human being or a search engine, you need great text to define the point of a website and attract users to it. Text size, alignment, and spacing is important, but the content that makes up that text is key.

---

## Devices and Screen Size

More and more users are now going online through mobile devices. One of the key concerns for designers is the large array of devices being used and the various screen sizes found on each one.

---

## Touch and Gestures

Touch screens have introduced a new kind of interaction where users no longer need a keyboard, mouse, or any other device to make it work. However, this has also created new usability issues to consider.

---

## Location and Time

Mobile users want content that specifically ties into their location. If you've been looking for ways to improve the usability of your app, tying into location based content is one great way to do it.

---

## Content Prioritization

Different websites provide different kinds of value. If we want to ensure that our designs are usable, we should understand what our users will want to do: consume or create.

---

## Data and Analytics

If you want to remove some of the guesswork from your design and decision making process, you'll need to collect and analyze data about your users.

---

## Usability Testing

No matter what role you play in the design or development of a website or app, you can do usability testing to improve it. By testing the most important goals users have on your site or app, you can ensure they work, and that your users will be successful.

---

## Design Frameworks

One way to ensure your designs are usable is to remove the guesswork and rely on code and best practices that are tried and true. That's why many designers and developers build sites using frameworks.
