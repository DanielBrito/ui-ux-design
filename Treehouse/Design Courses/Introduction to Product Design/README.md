# Introduction to Product Design - Notes

Over the last 10 years, design has proven to be essential to the success of a business. With the rise of the internet and more software being created, and as start-ups and tech companies realize the impact of design on the business and on digital products, there has been an increasing need for design. This course will help you understand and get familiar with product design, the role of design throughout product development and delivery, the different components of product design, and the process of designing digital products and experiences.

## Welcome to Product Design

Product Design is not graphic design or visual design, as it may be commonly perceived. While visual design is only one component of product design, the main focus of product design is understanding the user, the problem to solve, and designing the solution.

## Disciplines of Product Design

Product Design covers a wide breadth skills and disciplines of design. Depending on your company and team structure, these disciplines may be divided into individual roles or multiple roles. Whatever the structure may be, it is becoming increasingly important for product designers to broaden their skills within the entire product design process.

### **Definitions:**

- **User Research**: User research places people at the center of your design process and your products. It is used to inspire and inform your designs, to evaluate your solutions, and to measure the impact of your design.
- **User Experience (UX) Design**: User experience design, or UX design, is a human-first way of designing products, putting the user at the center and creating products that provide meaningful and personally relevant experiences to users. This involves improving a product’s usability, accessibility, and the pleasure people will get from using it.
- **User Interface (UI) Design**: User interface design, or UI design, is about translating a brand to a product’s interface, visually guiding the user with interactive elements across all sizes and platforms. This includes a mix of visual hierarchy and interface elements — the look and feel, the presentation, and the interactivity of a product.
- **Visual Design**: Visual design is about creating and making the general aesthetics of a product consistent and it aims to shape and improve the user experience through considering the effects of illustrations, photography, color, shapes, typography, space, and layouts on the usability of products and their aesthetic appeal.
- **Interaction (IxD) Design**: Interaction design, or IxD, is concerned with the way people interact with products and services. It considers how the user is interacting with the product, how the product responds to the user’s input.

## Universal Design Principles

- **Visibility of system status**
  The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
- **Match between system and the real world**
  The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
- **User control and freedom**
  Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
- **Consistency and standards**
  Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
- **Error prevention**
  Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
- **Recognition rather than recall**
  Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
- **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
  Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
  Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
- **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
  Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
- **Help and documentation**
  Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

## Company Design Principles

In addition to universal design principles, it’s important to have design principles that are unique and specific to your company/organization.

### Steps

- **Internal research:**
  - Leadership team
  - Product manager
  - Designers
  - Engineers
  - Customer Support
- **Tips to keep in mind:**
  - They must align with business goals and the user's goals
  - Keep it to about 3-5 principles
  - They should be specific enough to be used for making design decisions
  - They should be short and memorable
  - They should apply to the whole system
  - They shouldn't conflict or overlap

### Design Principals

**Foundation for design language** - The overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a product:

- Color
- Typography
- Iconography
- Shapes
- Patterns
- Grid Layouts
- Animation

### Design Principles - Example (Craigslist):

- **Discovery:** Create a seamless experience for users to discover posts
- **Basic and efficient:** The design is always basic and efficient for the user
- **Simple and straightforward:** Browsing or posting an item should be simple and straightforward
- **Consistent:** Users should feel very familiar to Craigslist.

## Discover

Understanding the user is one of the most important aspects of product design. Empathetic research is a process informed by deep qualitative data rather than statistical data. It focuses on people rather than technology, and it requires understanding and empathizing with them.

---

## Definition

Taking all of the insights from researching and learning about your users, we will learn how to distill all of the information and formulate problem statements. Identifying and defining the problem is an important step that will set the direction and focus for you and the rest of your team.

---

## Ideation

Based on everything you know about your users from your research, now it’s time to identify any pain points and define what the experience outcome is. This will set you up to then create an ideal flow or journey map, which will be the guide for you and your team.

### **Tools:**

- **[Journey Map Example](https://treehouse-project-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/ProductDesign/journey-map.png)**

---

## Test

Once you’ve narrowed down your solutions, it’s time to put them in front of users. We’ll go over some ways to create prototypes of your design and get them ready for user testing.

Create a user test to test your prototype with users. Then, based on the results of your user test, refine your design solution. This process of testing and refining your design may take a couple rounds.

- Is the solution working?
- What parts of the solution are working?
- What needs to be changed based on users’ feedback?

**Testing Prototype with Users:**

- Observe interaction
- Are they doing what you intended?
- Is your design clear or are users having difficulties?
- Is the user experience what they expected?
- Opportunities for improvement?

## Ship

The last phase of the design process is polishing your design and getting your files set up so that they are ready for build. This stage will depend largely on communicating and working with the engineers or developers on your team and understanding what they need from you to start building your design in code.

---

## Next Steps

Being aligned with your team throughout the whole process is crucial to creating a successful product. As the designer, you need to be in communication with those on your team and outside of your team (product managers, engineers, marketing designers, researchers, other product designers, etc). We’ll talk about when it’s important to collaborate and how to communicate with your team.

### **Definitions:**

- **Sprint**: A set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. It’s also one development cycle in a Scrum, which is a specialized agile method, or a specialized incremental development process
