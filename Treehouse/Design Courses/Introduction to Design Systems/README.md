## What is a Design System?

A design system is a set of rules that guide the design of a web site or app. Design systems help create predictable experiences for users, and help designers work more efficiently and build interfaces consistent with an organization’s visual brand without wasting time exploring design problems that have been solved already.

## Color

Design systems provide color documentation for three reasons: to limit the number of colors implemented by designers, to define context for color usage, and to make sure colors are used in an accessible manner.

## Typography

Typographic guidelines within design systems cover how to use type that's consistent with a company's brand as well as how to create inviting, readable body copy.

## Image

While most design systems don't cover photographic imagery, many do provide guidance for using icons–usually icons that were created specifically for the design system. And if a design system does allow for illustrations, expect robust rules on how and when to implement them.

## Introducing User Interface Libraries

To create a consistent user experience across applications, design systems provide strict rules for designing and coding interactive elements, just as they provide a visual design language.

## Introducing Voice and Tone

Over the following videos, we’ll examine examples of voice and tone guidelines, and learn why this is such a key feature of design system documentation. But first, let’s look at the two terms–voice, and tone–and understand what separates them.
