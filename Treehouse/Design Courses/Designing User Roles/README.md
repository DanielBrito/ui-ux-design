# Designing User Roles - Notes

Delve into the nuances of building a product for multiple audiences. Learn how user roles are defined and used. Recognize the importance of providing various permission levels, learn best practices, and analyze how B2B (business-to-business) products serve many types of users.

## Creating Experiences for User Roles

Learn how a user role defines the user's experience and controls what the user is able to see and do within a product.

**New terms:**

- _User role_: A name for a set of permissions that control what the user is able to see and do within a product.
- _B2B_: An abbreviation for "business-to-business". A B2B product serves businesses. For example, here are a few B2B companies: WeWork, Mailchimp, and Salesforce.
- _B2C_: An abbreviation for "business-to-consumer". A B2C product serves individual consumers. For example, these companies are mostly B2C: Chipotle, Target, and Instagram. It gets murky since they do serve businesses in some ways, but they're largely B2C.
- _Note_: Many companies are a hybrid of b2b and b2c. For instance, Apple sells computers to individuals and they also sell to businesses.
