## The Challenges of Handling Feedback

Listening to feedback can be challenging. Not all feedback is constructive or helpful. And it's important to recognize the emotions you may feel while receiving feedback.

**Challenges of receiving feedback**

- Emotional response
- Feedback quality
- Feedback direction

**Emotional responses to feedback**

_When feedback threatens our worth (sense of self-respect and confidence)..._

- Shame emotions: negative self talk, self-doubt, sadness, worthlessness, embarrassment, hurt

_When feedback threatens our safety (perceived physical, social, or material security)..._

- Secondary emotions: judgement, blame, anger, violence, betrayal, withdrawal, or denial
- Primary emotions: fear (anxiety, worry) and sadness (loss, disappointment, discouragement)

_When feedback causes disconnection (an emotional disconnection from the situation)..._

- Reactions: feeling numb, stunned, dumbfounded, flabbergasted, or shocked

## Types of Feedback

**Definitions**

- _Constructive criticism_: Feedback which points out where improvements can be made. It's clear and easy to take action on, without being prescriptive.
- _Non-constructive criticism_: Feedback which doesn't help you improve your design to meet the goals of the project. This type of feedback can leave you confused, unsure, and feeling as if your professional skills are in question.
- _Prescriptive feedback_: Feedback which tells the designer what to do. It doesn't clearly articulate why your solution isn't achieving the project goal, thereby making it difficult to learn from and act on.
- _Preferential feedback_: Feedback which is just the opinion of the person providing the feedback, and doesn't represent the project's audience.
- _Non-specific feedback_: Feedback which leaves no clear path forward and leaves the designer to play a guessing game.
- _Irrelevant feedback_: Feedback that is not applicable to the project
- _Untimely feedback_: Feedback that is given without consideration of the project timeline.
- _Selfish feedback_: Feedback that twists the design solution to the critic's advantage and not serving the target end user.
- _Off-topic feedback_: Feedback that doesn't pertain to the project or your role in the project.
- _Incomplete feedback_: Feedback which lacks an explanation
