# Design Criticism - Notes

## What is a critique?

It might seem like giving or receiving feedback is a negative thing, but that's not the case at all. In a professional environment, it's essential to talk to one another about the work you're doing in a constructive manner.

## Formulating Feedback

Let's break down how to form feedback into three parts: First you want to describe the work, then you want to interpret it by figuring out the goal of the work, and then finally you want to judge the work by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the execution of its goal.

### **Finding the Goal**

Here are some questions you can use to try and find the goal of a website:

- Who is the user of this website, and what are they trying to accomplish?
- Does this website feel familiar to you and would you know how to use it?
- What are some design patterns you recognize?
- What are the characteristics of a person that might use this site?
- How does this website fit into someone's everyday life?
- What's the main thing you can do on this website?

## Feedback example

Make sure that your feedback is objective and useful.

- Describe what you see.
- Interpret what you see. In other words, what is the goal of the site?
- Judge the strengths and weaknesses. Does this site accomplish its goal?
