## Typography: After

Walk through one approach to creating greater design clarity through improvements in typography.

### **Definitions**

- **Counter**: An area of a letter that is entirely or partially enclosed, such as the hole in an "O" or a "P" character.
- **Drop cap**: where the first letter of a paragraph is an enlarged capital letter.
- **Font pairing**: A combination of fonts that work well together in a design.
- **Line height**: Also called leading, this is the distance between two lines of type. It's calculated by measuring between the two baselines.
- **Pull quote**: A quotation which is taken from the body text and styled differently in order to make it stand out.
- **Type ratio**: The difference between the largest and smallest font size.
- **Type scales**: A method for creating balanced and harmonious font sizing.
- **x-height**: The distance between the baseline and the mean line of the lower-case letters. A tip is to look at the height of a lower-case letter x, hence the name.
