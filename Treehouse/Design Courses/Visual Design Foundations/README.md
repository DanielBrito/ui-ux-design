# Visual Design Foundations - Notes

## The Elements and Principles of Art and Design

The elements of art and design are the basic visual building blocks used to create an image. These are more familiar concepts, like line, shape, texture, color, and more. The principles of art and design are guidelines for combining elements together.

## Line, Shape, and Form

### **Definitions**

- **Line** - A point that moves continuously.
- **Shape** - Areas defined by contrast.
- **Form** - Geometry that exists in 3 dimensions.

---

## Space and Texture

When describing art, space can be divided into positive and negative space. Texture is what it feels like to touch something, or what something looks like it might feel like if it were touched.

### **Definitions**

- **Space** - The area or volume that's occupied (or not occupied) by something.
- **Texture** - The way it feels to touch something, or what something looks like it might feel like if it were touched.

## Value and Color

Value is the lightness or darkness of a tone or color, and color is the addition of hue and saturation to a value.

### **Definitions**

- **Value** - The lightness or darkness of a color or tone.
- **Color** - The combination of value, hue, and saturation.

### **Resources**

**[Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)** - Use this tool to explore color and create color schemes for websites, logos, and other design projects.

## Balance and Harmony

Balance is how equal or unequal a visual appears. Harmony is when combined elements complement one another.

### **Definitions**

- **Balance** - The appearance of equality in a composition.
- **Harmony** - Instances where combined elements complement one another.

## Emphasis, Variety, and Proportion

Emphasis and variety can be used to achieve more diversity in a composition. Proportion describes the relationship of elements to one another and to the whole composition.

### **Definitions**

- **Emphasis** - A more extreme difference between an element or a principle.
- **Variety** - Diversity in elements or principles.
- **Proportion** - The relationship of elements to one another and to the whole composition.

## Movement and Rhythm

Movement is a principle that can guide the viewer's eye. Rhythm is created when an element or principle shows up multiple times.

### **Definitions**

- **Movement** - The appearance of motion in a still image.
- **Rhythm** - Instances where repeated elements are grouped together in an identifiable pattern.
