# Information Architecture - Notes

## Defining Information Architecture

Information Architecture (IA): the way we organize, label, and connect the information on a website or app.

## IA and Related Design Concepts

- User Experience (UX) - the group of interactions a user has with a company or entity through its websites, apps, email, and everything else
- User Interface (UI) - the controls, sequences, and other functionality of a website or app that allows users to do what they want and get what they need
- Usability - making sure that something works well: that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can use the thing - whether it’s a Web site, a fighter jet, or a revolving door - for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated (source: Krug, *Don’t Make Me Think*)

## The Role of IA in Web Design and Development

No matter what your title is, if you’re involved with the design, development, or content creation on a website, information architecture is a vital concept to understand and follow. we will discuss how IA impacts design and development tasks, and how continued IA analysis can improve your site over time.

### **New Terms:**

- Sitemaps - visual representations of website pages and sections, showing the links between them to help a design/development team understand how it all works

## The Morville/Rosenfield Approach

### **New Terms:**

- Information ecology - the intersection of content, users, and context depicting what you create, who you’re creating it for, and why you’re creating it
- Organization schemes and structures - Dividing content into distinct groups to establish order and organization amongst a collection of content
- Labeling systems - Attaching a name to a group or category to provide context and understanding
- Navigation systems - Menus and other links used to provide the means to explore a website or app
- Search systems - Systems that allow users to enter various kinds of criteria to discover relevant content

## Organizing Content

One of the main components of information architecture is organization. How humans organize things helps them make sense of the world. How you organize information within a website or app will help your users make sense of it and ultimately determine their satisfaction.

### **New Terms:**

- Hierarchy - a specific kind of content organization where broad categories are broken down into smaller categories and so on, creating a structure that can be displayed within a tiered navigation menu

---

## Labeling Content

Once you organize content into groups, how do you label them? Labeling information provides the context users need to understand how your website or app is organized. Choosing labels that make sense and appeal to your users will be important to the success of your website or app.

---

## Navigation Systems

### **New Terms:**

- Global navigation - menu that shows the main sections of a website
- Local navigation - sub-menu that shows the main links within a section of a website
- Breadcrumbs - links that show where the current page is located with the sections or levels of the website
- Contextual links - links within the text in the body of a page

---

## Search Systems

### **New Terms**

- Exact search - when a user searches for the exact content they need by entering the name, ex: “2003 Ford Taurus for sale”
- Broad search - when a user searches for something using general terms without knowing the exact content they’ll find, ex: “4-door sedans for sale”
- Filtering - selecting different criteria during a search to narrow the results

---

## User Research

If you don’t know your users, your IA will only be as good as your best guess. There are multiple ways to learn about the users of your website and app to ensure you provide an experience that’s easy for them to learn, and easy to use to accomplish goals.

---

## Card Sorting

### **New Terms**

- Card sorting - a testing activity where users divide content cards into groups - and in many cases, name those groups - to help designers and developers understand the users’ perspective of content labels, groupings, and relationships
- Open card sort - card sorting activity where users are asked to name the groups they’ve created
- Closed card sort - card sorting activity where users are asked to divide content into existing categories

---

## Competitor Research

Monitoring your competitors can be one of the quickest ways to spot trouble areas within your own website. By analyzing how websites with similar content organize and provide access to their information, it’s possible to adapt your current information architecture to meet the needs of your users.

## Improving Website Organization

Now that we know how websites can be organized, which way is best for you? In this video, we will discuss how to choose an organizational structure for your website or app.

### **New terms:**

- Tree Testing - show someone a text version of the structure of a website and ask them to follow the ‘branches’ to select the spot where they think they’d find an important piece of information

---

## Improving Functions and Processes

### **New terms:**

- Usability test - a test used to determine the usability of a website or app design; test users try to complete a common task and results may show how the average user makes decisions and is able to interpret the information and interface they encounter.
