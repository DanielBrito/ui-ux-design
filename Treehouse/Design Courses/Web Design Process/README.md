# Notes - Web Design Process

## Setting Goals

Going from a blank screen to a finished website can be daunting. What's the best way to get started, and what are the rest of the steps involved? Good designers don't immediately start creating color palettes or coding a web page. Instead, they start by learning the goals of the site.

### **Question Ideas for Stakeholders**

- How important is this product launch to the company?
- How does this product connect with the company's brand?
- How does this product relate to other products the company has released in the past?
- What does success look like for this website?
- How is this website different than our competitors?
- What problem is the product solving for customers?
- How would you describe a typical customer?

## Understanding the Audience

In order to successfully reach the goals you've set for a website, you have to understand the target audience.

## Gathering Content

Once you've spent time setting goals for the site and gathering information about the target audience, you should collect all of the content you'll need to put together your design.

## Prototyping with Wireframes

A wireframe is a simple version of the final product. Similar to how buildings are made using a simple blueprint drawing, websites are typically first designed with simple black and white lines that help frame where each piece of content should go.

## Mobile First Design

While it might be tempting to think about what the site might look like on a desktop, we're going to start with the mobile version first.

_"When you create a desktop website and work your way back to a mobile design, there's a temptation to fill in all the available space. Then it's hard to condense all of those elements onto the screen of a mobile device. Thinking mobile first is a lot easier because you can start with the simplest version that includes the most important details and then expand on those ideas to create the desktop design."_

## Iterating on a Design

An iteration is one version of your project, and there will likely be several versions between the start and the final product. When creating a design, your first idea is almost never your best idea.
